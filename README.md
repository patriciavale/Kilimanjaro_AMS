# Kilimanjaro_AMS
An application's prototype for an outdoor activity focused company. Made for the Analysis And Modelling Of Systems (AMS) course, in University of Aveiro.

## Introduction
Kilimanjaro allows its users to buy a ticket, accommodation and transport in one single application. It is designed for adventurous people looking for their next journey.

## The application
This application is composed by an extensive number of screens where the user can navigate through. These are divided into the following categories:
 - **Start** (Sign up and log in)
 - **Discover** (List of activities and their details)
 - **Suggested** (Suggested activities and their details)
 - **Saved** (Saved activities and their details)
 - **Notification** (User's notifications, such as chat messages)
 - **Profile** (The user's profile)
 - **Administration** (Administrative tools, available only to the administrator)
